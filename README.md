# Big-Data-Analytics-Lab_8cs4-21

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

With the advance of IT storage, processing, computation, and sensing technologies, Big Data has become a novel norm of life. Only until recently, computers are able to capture and analysis all sorts of large-scale data from all kinds of fields -- people, behaviour, information, devices, sensors, biological signals, finance, vehicles, astrology, neurology, etc. Almost all industries are bracing into the challenge of Big Data and want to dig out valuable information to get insight to solve their challenges.
